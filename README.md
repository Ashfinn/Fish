# Fish 
A Shell Client built in C++

[![progress-banner](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/shell/d2c1f252-4929-4703-a65a-863874d64979)](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/codecrafters-bot?r=2qF)

This repository contains **Fish**, a POSIX-compliant shell client built in C++ as part of the [Codecrafters "Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview). The shell is capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs, and handling built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and more.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Fish is designed to be a lightweight and simple shell client built in C++ that complies with POSIX standards. It is capable of interpreting a variety of shell commands and managing both external programs and built-in shell functionalities.

Key features include:
* Running external programs.
* Built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and more.
* Learning about shell command parsing and REPL loops.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* GCC (or any C++ compiler)
* Make (optional, for easier build management)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ashfinn/fish.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd fish
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can execute common shell commands such as:
* `pwd` - Print the current directory.
* `cd` - Change directory.
* `echo` - Output text to the terminal.
* Run external programs like `ls`, `cat`, etc.

You can type commands directly into the Fish shell, just as you would in a standard Unix shell.

_For more usage examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
