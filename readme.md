- **Audio Playback and Recording**: Real-time playback, multi-track recording, and support for various audio formats.
- **Track Management**: Track creation, deletion, naming, color coding, and control over volume and panning.
- **Audio Editing**: Cut, copy, paste, trim, fade in/out, normalize, reverse, time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and more.
- **Effects and Plugins**: Built-in effects (EQ, reverb, delay), VST/AU plugin support, and customizable effect chains.
- **Mixer and Routing**: Mixer interface, audio routing, bus management, and sub-mixing.
- **MIDI Support**: MIDI recording, playback, editing, and instrument support.
- **Export and Rendering**: Export audio and notation to various formats, batch processing, and project archiving.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- **Set Up Development Environment**: Configure IDE, libraries (JUCE, PortAudio, MusicXML for notation), version control (Git), and project structure.
- **Basic UI Setup**: Create the main application window, implement a menu bar, and set up basic areas for track view, notation, and editing.

### Phase 2: Music Notation Module
- **Notation Editor**: Develop a notation editor with support for standard musical symbols, time signatures, and key signatures.
- **Notation UI**: Implement a UI for creating and editing sheet music.
- **Playback from Notation**: Integrate the notation editor with the playback engine to allow users to hear their compositions.

### Phase 3: Track Management and Audio Playback
- **Implement Track Class**: Develop a `Track` class with properties like `name`, `color`, `volume`, `pan`, and functions for track management.
- **Track Management in UI**: Display and manage tracks in the UI, including adding, removing, and reordering tracks.
- **Implement Basic Audio Playback**: Set up the audio engine and implement real-time playback for single and multi-tracks.

### Phase 4: Audio Recording and Editing
- **Basic Audio Recording**: Enable audio recording from input devices and support multi-track recording.
- **Basic Editing Functions**: Implement cut, copy, paste, delete, and trimming for audio clips.
- **Advanced Editing Features**: Add fade in/out, normalize, reverse, time-stretching, and pitch-shifting.
- **Clip Management in UI**: Display and edit audio clips on the timeline.

### Phase 5: Effects, Plugins, and Mixing
- **Implement Built-In Effects**: Create basic effects like EQ, reverb, delay, and real-time processing.
- **Plugin Support (VST/AU)**: Integrate VST/AU plugin support, and manage plugin parameters in the UI.
- **Mixer Interface**: Design and implement the mixer interface, allowing real-time adjustments to track volume, pan, and effects.
- **Routing and Bus Management**: Implement audio routing, sub-mixing, group tracks, and automation for mixer controls.

### Phase 6: MIDI Support and Export Features
- **MIDI Support**: Implement MIDI recording, playback, and editing, with support for MIDI instruments.
- **Notation to MIDI Conversion**: Allow users to convert sheet music into MIDI sequences for playback and editing.
- **Export and Rendering**: Implement functionality to export tracks, entire projects, and sheet music to various formats.

### Phase 7: Testing, Optimization, and Finalization
- **Unit and Integration Testing**: Write and perform tests for individual components and system integration.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize audio processing, notation rendering, and overall system performance.
- **Bug Fixing and Refinement**: Fix bugs, refine features, and improve user experience based on testing.

### Phase 8: Final Release and Documentation
- **Documentation**: Write user guides, tutorials, and technical documentation for developers.
- **Beta Release and Feedback**: Release a beta version, collect feedback, and make final adjustments.
- **Final Release**: Package and distribute the final version of the software.
